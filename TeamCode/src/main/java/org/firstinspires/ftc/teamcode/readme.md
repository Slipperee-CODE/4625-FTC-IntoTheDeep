- Implement ExampleWaitingAuto (Including RoadRunner)
  - Use the RoadRunner Action class and bake that into your custom Mechanism class 
    - Actions continue to occur in their run() method as long as the method returns true
    - https://rr.brott.dev/docs/v1-0/actions/#overview
  - Figure out the best way of combining RoadRunner trajectories with mechanism actions

- Implement MeepMeep
